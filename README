2) But Is It Free?

   Yes, for non-commercial use. No money, donations, etc are required.

   However, I do collect coins from around the World, so if you use
   and like XAnim and want to help motivate me to put more effort
   into it, you can send whatever coins you feel like donating to:

		Mark Podlipec
		15 Meadow Lane
		Shrewsbury MA 01545 USA

   Doesn't matter what the value or condition they are in. However,
   since I do have the majority of the 20th century US coins, I'm not
   as interested in them. Again, this is strictly voluntary.
   You can see the collection by visting:

   For commercial use, a licensing agreement is required.  You
   may send enquiries to:

3) Now What?

   XAnim is distributed as source code and needs to be compiled on
   your machine before you'll be able to use it.   You'll need to
   have the following installed on your machine:

		C compiler 
		X11 includes
		X11 libraries

   1) Read through the "README.dll" file.

   2) Read through the "README.zlib" file.

   3) Read through the README.* file that corresponds to the type
      of machine that you have. For example, README.sunos

   4) Now read the "Compile_Help.doc" file provides step by step 
      instructions on how to compile XAnim on unix machines.

   If you have a VMS machine, please see the "VMS_Help.doc" file. I
   apologize that the VMS instructions aren't as detailed, but
   I don't know much about that OS, yet.

   The "Compile_Errs.doc" file contains common compile errors and their
   solutions. 

   The "Problems.doc" file describes common warning and error messages
   that you might encounter while running XAnim.

   The "audio.readme" contains machine specific audio information.
   This file is slowly being rolled up into the specific readmes.

   The file "Examples.doc" gives some common usage examples on running
   xanim. The "xanim.readme" or "xanim.man" page contians much more
   detailed description of all the options and has sections describing
   various features in depth.


3) What are all these other files?

   This archive contains the source to XAnim(all the .xbm, .h and .c files)
   and needs to be compiled on your machine in order to produce an
   XAnim executable. Below is a list and brief description of all
   the files in this archive.

4) If you have a problem running or compiling that the documentation
   doesn't cover or if you find a bug  you can contact me at:

		podlipec@ici.net

   Please include the following information in your email message:

	1) The rev of XAnim.
	2) Type of machine and OS.
	3) A description of the problem:
		+ including the type of animation.
	   	+ any options used.
		+ full error messages and/or xanim output.

5) XAnim Mailing List

   I have an announcement email list that you may join if you wish
   to get email when there are new XAnim releases.

   To Subscribe/Unsubscribe send email to:

           podlipec@ici.net

   with the words "xanim subscribe" or "xanim unsubscribe" in either the
   Subject or Message Body. It would also be best to include
   your email address since I've found a lot of mailer's do not
   include the correct reply address in the mail headers.

   Unfortunately, this part of the list maintenance isn't automated yet, so 
   bare with me as I usually only make the additions before each new
   XAnim releases.

   Bug reports should still be sent to:

           podlipec@ici.net

   I do attempt to reply to all the email messages I receive, however, I get
   quite a few with invalid return addresses. If you don't hear from me
   within a week, double check that your return address is correct.


6) Alright, What's New?  The Rev_History.doc should/will/has a complete
   list of what's new to this particular revision, but this section
