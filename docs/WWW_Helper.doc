This file contains instructions on how to setup your WWW browser
so that it calls up XAnim for the various animation/audio/video
files that you download.

NOTE: You can use the +q option to suppress the startup message
from XAnim. This is useful if your browser pops up a separate
window for such output. The +q option would be added to the
options in the .mailcap. See section 2 below.

There's three things you need to do in order to get your WWW browser
to properly call up XAnim for the files that XAnim can support.

1) Setup your ".mime.types" file.  This maps file extensions into
   MIME types and subtypes. It's not real important what you
   call these types, although there are a few that have already
   been defined.

   Here's mine  ".mime.types" file as an example:

video/mpeg      mpg mpeg
video/quicktime mov qt moov MooV hqx qtvr
video/fli       fli flc
video/avi       avi
video/dl        dl
video/sgi       mv movi
video/anim      anim iff anim5 anim3 anim7
audio/x-mpeg    mp mp2
audio/wav       wav
audio/au        au
image/jpg       jpg jpeg



2) Setup your ".mailcap" file.  This file indicates what applications,
   like xanim, xv, etc, to call up when presented with a certain
   Mime type/subtype(same ones defined in the .mime.types above.

   Here's mine:

image/jpg;      xv -owncmap %s ;
video/*;        /usr/podlipec/bin/xanim +v -Cn %s ;
audio/x-mpeg;   /usr/podlipec/bin/maplay_sunos4_1_3 %s ;
audio/*;        /usr/podlipec/bin/xanim +v %s ;


3) Tell your brower(s) to use the .mime.types and .mailcap files you
   just created/modified. This is dependent upon whatever browser 
   you have.

   a) Mosaic:  Mosaic looks in your home directory(as defined
      by your HOME env variable for the .mailcap and .mime.types
      files.  You might need to restart Mosaic after changing
      these files in order to have them take affect.

   b) Netscape 1.1:

	Go into the Options:Preferences:Helper Applications Menu.

        You'll see a form to indicate the locations of the Mailcap
        and Types files. Enter in the full path to the .mailcap
        and the .mime.types file here.  Then go back and use
        the  Options:Save_Options  menu.

   c) Netscape 2.0:

	Go into the Options:General Preferences:Helpers Menu.
      
        You'll see a form to indicate the locations of the Mailcap
        and Types files. Enter in the full path to the .mailcap
        and the .mime.types file here.  Then go back and use
        the  Options:Save_Options  menu.

that came with them.
