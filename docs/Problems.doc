This file describes some of the common warnings and errors that
you might encounter while running XAnim 2.70.3 and above.

For the purposes of most of the errors messages, assume this
was the command line:

			"xanim anim_file"


1) Unable to open/read animation:  anim_file

    This means either XAnim was unable to find the file "anim_file"
    or it did not have read permission for file "anim_file".
   
2) Unknown or unsupported animation type: anim_file
 
    XAnim doesn't recognize "anim_file" as being in a format
    that it supports.

3)  malloc err

   If "malloc err" occurs, either by itself or within a sentence, it
   means that you do not have enough memory to view that particular
   animation with the options you selected.

   For most animation formats, the "+f" option can significantly
   reduce memory usage, but can lead to audio/video sync problems
   if playing back from a CDROM.  Also note, not all formats can
   make use of the +f option. See "xanim.readme" for more details
   on this subject.

4) AVI Video Codec: Intel Indeo R3.x depth=24 is unsupported by this executable.
   QT Video Codec:  Intel Indeo R3.x depth=24 is unsupported by this executable.
   AVI Video Codec: Radius Cinepak depth=24 is unsupported by this executable.
   QT Video Codec:  Radius Cinepak depth=24 is unsupported by this executable.

   Or similiar.

   If you get one of the above errors messages, it means that you
   did not compile in Radius Cinepak or Intel Indeo support into
   XAnim. You will want to read the "cinepak.readme" and "intel.readme"
   for instructions on how to do this.

   Since different files are required for each machine/OS combination, 
   the readme files distributed with your particular revision of XAnim 
   may be out of date as I add support for newer machines. In which
   case you'll want to grab the latest readme files at the following
   WWW sites:

        http://xanim.va.pubnix.com/home.html
        http://smurfland.cit.buffalo.edu/xanim/home.html
        http://www.tm.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/xanim/

   or via anonymous ftp from ftp xanim.va.pubnix.com [199.170.0.28]

5) Video Codec: Unknown XXXX(7768616d) depth=8 is unsupported by this exec.

   Where XXXX is any four letter combination.

   Both AVI and Quicktime files can make use of many different Video
   Codecs. New ones are being developed all the time and most of them
   are proprietary and specs are not readily available(if at all).
   Also, many Video Codecs can have different depths. XAnim may
   support one depth, but not another.  The depth has nothing to
   do with your display type.

   The above warning message indicates that XAnim is not familiar
   with that particular Video Codec. You should contact me with
   the above information, where you obtained the animation file
   and any other information that might help me identify the
   Vendor/Software responsible for producing it. I can then
   attempt to obtain the specifications from them so that I
   may support that format, providing there are no licensing fees.

6) Warning: No supported Video frames found.

   This occurs in when XAnim can not find any video frames
   inside a Quicktime or AVI file.  Current revisions of
   XAnim do not support audio only Quicktime/AVI files.
   This will change in the near future.

7) AVI vid dlta: read failed

   This is a warning message. It means XAnim encountered the
   end of the animation file BEFORE it was supposed to. This
   typically occurs when an animation file was truncated
   for whatever reason. It is common for this to occur
   when downloading via the WWW during peak traffic hours.

   XAnim will still display any full frames that it
   found before the end of the file.

8) QT: file possibly truncated or missing .rsrc info

   Quicktime animations usually store critical file
   headers at the very end of the file. If the file
   was truncated for whatever reason, then these
   headers are missing and the file is unplayable
   by anything.

   This can also occur if the file was not properly
   transferred from the Macintosh and the critical
   headers were no added to the end of the data
   fork. Again, not playable.

   NOTE: 27062 incorrectly reports this error with the
    new format quicktimes. 27063 fixes this.

9) QT: This is only .data fork. Need .rsrc fork

   This means the Quicktime animation was not
   properly prepared and transferred from the
   Macintosh. Critical header information is
   missing. This file is unplayable by anything.
