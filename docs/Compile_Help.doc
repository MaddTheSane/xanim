         Compiling the Audio Revisions of XAnim(2.70.* and up)

In the following help section,  the "2800" part is variable and
depends on the revision(in this case Rev 2.80.0). 
Another example: Rev 2.88.3 would be "2883".

Section I    Obtaining XAnim
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Obtaining the XAnim archive through ftp:
	1) ftp xanim.va.pubnix.com     OR  ftp 208.240.89.238
	2) Enter "anonymous" as user(don't include quotes)
	3) Enter your full email address as the password.
	4) "type binary"
        6a) "get xanim2800.tar.Z"     For the unix compressed version
                OR
        6b) "get xanim2800.tar.gz"    For the gnu zipped version
	7) bye

Obtaining XAnim through mosaic or a browser:
  If you obtained the xanim archive through mosaic or another www browser,
  then you need to be aware of whether or not it was automatically
  uncompressed as it was transferred. Different browsers do different things.

	A) If your browser uncompressed XAnim then save the file
	   as "xanim2800.tar" and skip the uncompress steps in
	   sections I) or II).
	B) If your browers didn't uncompress XAnim then save the file
	   as "xanim2800.tar.Z".
        C) If you're not sure then: 
	     1) save the file as "xanim2800"
             2) "ls -l xanim2800"
                 a) if the size is < 600K, then it's compressed and you
		    should "mv xanim2800 xanim2800.tar.Z".
	         b) else it's not compressed and you should
		    "mv xanim2800 xanim2800.tar". NOTE: skip the
		    uncompress steps below.
		 c) You can also compare the size to the sizes listed 
                    on the XAnim WWW page in order to determine what
                    you browser did.

Section II    Unarchiving
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

    1a) uncompress xanim2800.tar.Z    For the unix compressed version
               OR
    1b) gunzip xanim2800.tar.gz       For the gnu zipped version
    2) tar xvof xanim2800.tar
    3) cd xanim2800

Section III   Compiling
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that you've got it, what do you do?  

Part A) 
   If you are using OpenWindows(with SunOS 4.1.3) goto Part B.
   OpenWindows with SunOS 5.x should be okay here, but not positive.
   If you know that Imake is NOT setup on your system, goto Part B.
   If you're not sure about Imake, try it anyways and on any failure
   goto Part B and skip any initial steps you've already done.
   Imake for a lot of linux releases is broken. See 2nd entry of
   "Compile_Errs.doc" for details on how to fix.

    1) Read the following files:
           README.dll
           README.zlib
    2) If you aren't using XA_DLL then also read the following:
           <a href="ZZfiledirZZ_cinepak.readme">cinepak.readme</a>
           <a href="ZZfiledirZZ_indeo.readme">indeo.readme</a>
           <a href="ZZfiledirZZ_creative.readme">creative.readme</a>
    3) Read and edit the Imakefile. Visit each section and
          a) Modify section IIIa based on info in the file "README.dll".
          b) Modify section IIIb based on info in the file "README.zlib".
          c) Modify section IIIc based on info in the "cinepak.readme",
             "indeo.readme" and "creative.readme"  files. NOTE: ONLY IF
             YOU ARE NOT USING THE DLLs(see step a above).
          d) In Section IV.a, indicate where the X11 includes and libs
             are located on your machine.
          e) Modify Section IV.b based on which rev of X11 you are running.
          f) In Section VI indicate which XA_AUDIO_DEFS/LIBS/etc is correct
             for your particular machine/OS combination.
          g) Check Section VII for any machine or OS specific notes, etc.
    4) xmkmf
    5) make xanim
    6) NOTE: you should use "make xaclean" instead of "make clean" if you
       wanted to preserve the cinepak/indeo decompression modules.
       I haven't found a way to override Imake's clean yet.

    If steps 2) or 3) failed, then your system most likely isn't setup up
    properly for Imake(xmkmf). Either talk to your System Administrator
    or goto Part B.


Part B)
    IF  Part A ABOVE FAILED, OR Imake ISN'T PROPERLY SETUP OR YOU'RE USING
    Sun OpenWindows INSTEAD OF X11

    1) Read the "cinepak.readme" and "indeo.readme" files.
    2) cp Makefile.unx Makefile
    3) Edit the Makefile and:
          a) Read and possibly modify Section IIa and IIb.
          b) Modify section IIIa based on info in the file "README.dll".
          c) Modify section IIIb based on info in the file "README.zlib".
          d) Modify section IIIc based on info in the "cinepak.readme",
             "indeo.readme" and "creative.readme"  files. NOTE: ONLY IF
             YOU ARE NOT USING THE DLLs(see "b)" above).
          f) In Section IV.a, indicate where the X11 includes and libs
             are located on your machine.
          g) Modify Section IV.b based on which rev of X11 you are running.
          h) In Section VI indicate which XA_AUDIO_DEFS/LIBS/etc is correct
             for your particular machine/OS combination.
          i) Check Section VII for any machine or OS specific notes, etc.


    3) On Suns you need to have your LD_LIBRARY_PATH match the XLIBDIR
       define inside the Makefile. If it doesn't, you might end up mismatching
       different revs of X11 includes and libraries, causing all sorts of
       failures(usually undefined symbols). NOTE: This also has to match
       when you try executing XAnim, or it may not be able to find the 
       proper libraries.

	To find out what you LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set to: 

        	"env | grep LD"

	The following examples are for OpenWindows(XLIBDIR = /usr/openwin/lib) 
	To set it up properly for OpenWindows in the (C shell):

        	"setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /usr/lib:/usr/openwin/lib"

	To set it up properly for OpenWindows in the (Korn, Bourne and 
	POSIX shells):

        	"LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/usr/openwin/lib"
        	"export LD_LIBRARY_PATH"

	NOTE: No spaces around "=" sign.

    7) make xanim

    If your not sure where your X11 libs or includes are, your SysAdm should
    know or I can help as well. Also the Makefile.unx file has example places
    on where to look.
