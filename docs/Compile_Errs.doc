 This file needs to be updated as time permits. And perhaps areas
 from problems common to specific machines.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:

	You are using gcc and Solaris 2.6 and get the following
	error when compile stuff(xanim included):

        /usr/include/sys/model.h:32: #error "No DATAMODEL_NATIVE specified"

Solution:

	You need to use a gcc that has been compiled/installed specifically
	for Solaris 2.6.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem:

	You are using Imake and XFree and the compiler can't find
	the X11 include files and you have installed the X11 include
	files.

Solution:

	The Imake setup with XFree has recently been broken. The fix
	is to edit the file:

		/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/config/X11.tmpl

	and change the following line from:

		INCDIR = $(INCROOT)		/* header files */

	to be:

		INCDIR = $(INCROOT)/X11		/* header files */

	and then redo "xmkmf" and "make xanim"

	XFree needs to fix this in their next release.

-------------
Problem

	The compiler reports:

	   In file included from xa_audio.c:224:
	   xa_audio.h:42: stropts.h: No such file or directory
	   xa_audio.h:46: sun/audioio.h: No such file or directory

Solution
	By default, the XAnim makefiles are configured for SunOS audio.

	If you are using another platform(like linux, Solaris, HP, SGI, etc)
	then you need to edit the Makefile and select the XA_AUDIO* defines
	for your particular machine.

-------------
Problem

	When adding the XAnim decompression modules the 
	Compiler(linker actually) reports something similiar to:

	  ld: elf error: file xa2.0_iv32_sparcELF.o: unknown type, unable 
	  to process using elf(3E) libraries


Probable Reasons

	The decompress modules are probably still compressed. Verify
	their size with size listed in the readme files. If necessary,
	rename  "mv lib lib.Z" and then "uncompress lib.Z".

-------------
Problem:

     Compiler reports following symbols as undefined
     >   ld: Undefined symbol
     >      _XtStrings
     >      _XtShellStrings

Possible Reason:  

   Your LD_LIBRARY_PATH doesn't match the XLIBDIR that is in the Makefile. 
   This is because you're using the /usr/openwin/X11/includes, and some
   unrelated X11 library release(usually /usr/lib/X11).

-------------
Problem

	SGI Compiler core dumps. (A long standing feature of theirs :)

Solution:

	Uncomment out the following define in the Makefile:

	XA_SGI1 = -old_ld -32

-------------
Problem
	Compiler can't find  -lX11, -lXext, etc


Probable Reason:

	This are the X11 libraries, libX11.*, libXext.*  and most likely
	the XLIBDIR defines wasn't set correctly in the Makefile.

	Verify that XLIBDIR is set to the directory in which those files
	are located.

-------------
Problem:

     Compiler reports following symbols as undefined
     > .XShmDetach
     > .XShmPutImage
     > .XShmAttach
     > .XShmCreateImage
     > .XShmQueryExtension
     > compile FAILED.

Probable Reason: 

   Your machine doesn't support X11 Shared Memory Extension.
     
   These are all X11 Shared memory extensions and NOT all machines
   supports them.  So, you'll want to edit Imakefile or Makefile and
   comment out the following line:

   XA_SHARED = -DXSHM

   If you're using Imakfile you need to "xmkmf" and "make xanim"
   or if you're using Makefile.unx, just "make xanim".

-------------
Problem:  

    Compiler reports the following on HP machines:

     anyfilename: too much defining - use -H option
     anyfilename: no space

    The solution is uncomment out the following line in the Makefile

     XA_HPUX_DEFS = -Wp,-H200000

    and then recompile
