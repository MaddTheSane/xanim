This document will eventually describe how to use the Remote Window
aspect of XAnim.   This allows XAnim to be controlled from another
program using X11 Change Property calls.  

The file "proptest.c" gives an example on how to send these commands
to XAnim and can be used to test this feature.

NOTE: this feature is currently ONLY enabled if you use the +W# option
to XAnim.

The following commands sent via the ChangeProperty are currently supported.
You'll notice that they're very similiar to the keyboard commands that may
be typed into the XAnim window.

     q         quit.
     <space>   Toggle. starts/stops animation.
     ,         Single step back one frame.
     .         Single step forward one frame.
     m         Single step back one frame staying within anim.
     /         Single step forward one frame staying within anim.
     -         Increase animation playback speed.
     =         Decrease animation playback speed.
     0         Reset animation playback speed to original values.
     1         Decrement volume by 10.
     2         Decrement volume by 1.
     3         Increment volume by 1.
     4         Increment volume by 10.
     s         Toggle. Audio Volume(MUTE). on/off.
     8         Toggle. Main Speaker. on/off.
     9         Toggle. Headphones. on/off.
     v#        Setup volume where # is an number from 0 to 100.
		For example v53  or v78
     e         force expose if anim running. Needs to be improved.


Eventually commands will be added to set the frame, etc.  Also there
may eventually be a status returned by a similiar mechanism.
