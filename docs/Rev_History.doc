TBD work prior revision history back in.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO (not in any specific order)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ Add kludge for 24 bit X11 Visuals that are only 3 bytes per
          pixel instead of the normal 4 bytes per pixel.
	  Performance-wise, this will always be slower than the 4 bytes
	  case(faster to write 32 bits once than 8 bits three times).
	  Unclear yet whether I'll optimize for this case.
	+ Add playback as file downloads for AVI and FLI files.
	+ Move audio codecs to dlls.
	+ Redo audio API to allow for greater flexibilty.
	+ Add audio conversion routines to output stereo sound.
	+ Improve GUI
	    + toggle for internal/headphones/lineout
	    + scrollbar for video frame #
	+ Make use of X11 resources
	+ MPEG Type P and Type B frame support
	+ Enable more formats to be supported by serial streams.
	  (like JPEG, MPEG, etc). 
	+ add +f option for GIF images.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known Bugs:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

	+ QT	The quicktime edit chunk isn't fully supported. So
		Quicktimes that have gaps in the audio or video
		track don't sync up correctly.

	+ QT	Quicktime 3.0 introduced features like embedded URLs
		and files which don't store any audio/video directly
		but instead reference other files that do.
		These aren't supported yet.

	+ X11	XFree  introduced a non-standard Visual - packed 24bpps.
		Note that I'm not talking depth, I'm talking bpp(bits 
		per pixel).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.7.0  (20Mar98)  What happened to 1997?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ SGI MOVI:	Added support for MVC2 video codec
	+ SGI MOVI:	Added support for RGB uncompressed video codec
	+ AVI:		RGB24 is now padded correctly.
	+ AVI:		RLE8 where width not multiple of 4 is now fixed.
	+ AVI:		Added support for the MS GSM 6.10 audio codec.
			  :GSM support is from source code made available by
			  :Jutta Degener/Carsten Bormann of the Communications
			  :and Operating Systems Research Group (KBS) at the
			  :Technische Universitaet Berlin.  See the copyright
			  :notice at the top of the "xa_gsm.c" file.
			  : The AVI/WAV GSM is 320 samples in 65 bytes.
			  : The Quicktime GSM is 160 samples in 33 bytes.
	+ WAV:		Added support for the MS GSM 6.10 audio codec.
	+ QT:		Added support for the GSM 6.10 audio codec.
	+ QT:		Fixed problem supporting Quicktime 3.0. Would
			incorrectly report missing .data section.

	+ GIF:		Adam Moss added code to handle disposal methods.
	+ GIF:		Fixed bug in generated clip mask for tranparent images.
	+ Show:		Eric Shaw sent code to tile Video to X11 root window.
			Option is +root. 
	+ Util:		Adam Moss optimized scaling routines for speed.
	+ X11:		The default Visual is now used by default instead
			of selecting the deepest one.
	+ Misc:		The +f option is now on by default. So XAnim will
			not read the entire animation into memory first.
			Most hard drives are fast enought that this won't
			slow things down by much.  It's on NFS mounted
			partitions that heavy slow downs could occurs(and
			in which case use -f).

	+ Misc:		bunch of other minor fixes that I don't remember.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.6.4  (26Jan97) SuperBowl XXXI Sunday: Patriots vs Packers and I'm torn.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ SGI MOVI:	fixed bug with MVC1 compression and 16/24 X11 dpys.
        + Audio:	Add some more conversions(uLaw, armLaw) for machines 
			with 8 bit PCM audio.
	+ AUDIO:	NetBSD some more tweaks by Dowdeswell.
	+ AUDIO:	BSDI/OS v2.1 support tweak added. (Jay Vassos-Libove)
        + REMOTE:	tweaked buttons so they'll stay down a minum 
			time when pressed to provide better visual feed back.
	+ Indeo:	fixed bug with YUV to RGB conversion for odd sized
			images.
	+ AUDIO:	Steve Waterworth fixed up HP Aserver code.
	+ JFIF:		fixed bug with +b switch and JPEG images.

        + Looping:	fixed bug when pingponging in FLIs
        + Looping:	Pressing the "p" key inside anim window will now
			toggle the pingpong flag which affects how the
			animation is looped. see "xanim.readme"
	+ X11:    	Fixed bug with TrueColor visuals that had colormaps
			greater than 256 entries.(ie XFree86's 32bpp)

	+ Remote Window Commands and Control added. See +W* options
          in the xanim.readme/xanim.man files and see the
	  Remote_Window.doc file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.6.3  (02Aug96)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ AVI:  fixed bug with RGB depth 24  on depth 16 Displays.
	+ IMA4: fixed bug that caused audio noise with quicktimes
		that used the stereo IMA4  audio codec.
	+ MISC: Fixed colormap problem with -Cn and audio only files.
	+ JPG:  JPEG 111111 fixed color bug with dither/+Cn option.
	+ MISC: cleaned up type casting for functions that return ptrs
                to void *functions. 
        + QT:	There's a new variation to the quicktime file format
		where the headers are stored up front(allows streaming
		of quicktime animations). Previous xanim revs had
		trouble reading this.
	+ AUDIO: Roland sent in modifications to the NetBSD audio code
		 to improve support for a wider variety of cards.
	+ AUDIO: Minor mods for Digital Unix 3.2C MME 1.60

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.6.2  (06Jun96)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ CVID:  broke grayscale cvid animations. If you already
		 have 27061 then edit "xa_qt.c" and change line 1127 from: 
		   ---
		    }
		   ---
	         to be: 
		   ---
		    }
		    if (qt->depth == 40) qt->depth = 8;
		   ---
	         and recompile.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.6.1  (05Jun96)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ KPCD:  Fixed Minor warning that some fanatical compilers
                 considered an error. :^)   No reason to upgrade
                 to this is you can compile 2.70.6

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.6  (04Jun96)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ REMOTE:  Petunia volume scrollbar is now settable with mouse.
	+ REMOTE:  -Zr wasn't working with Petunia.
	+ REMOTE:  some compile errors when compiling with no remote control.
	+ AVI:     hooks for Creative CYUV Video Codec added. 
			see creative.readme for instructions.
	+ AVI:     Added support for WHAM video codec(same as CRAM).
	+ QT:	   Added support for Kodak Photo CD Video Codec.
	+ QT:	   Added support for RAW depth 1 Video Codec
	+ QT:	   Added support for RLE depth 4 Video Codec
	+ QT:	   Added support for Microsoft Video 1 Video Codec.
	+WAV:	   large audio chunks are broken into smaller chunks
		   artificially by xanim to improve +f memory usage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.5.4 (01May96)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ Okay, I screwed up. I had changed over to long ints. Big
          mistake. Changing back. This won't affect machines with 32
          data paths. Alpha users need to revert back to the xa2.0_
          decompression modules.

	+ AUDIO: Fixed bug where audio_ring can occasionally get out
                 of sync between the update and the audio_out pointers.
       

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.5.3 (28Apr96)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ This is just a clean up release. Fixed all the "gcc -Wall"
          warnings on both linux and SunOS 4.1.3 machines.
          Some of these warnings were(or were treated) as compile 
	  errors on SGI and Alpha machines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.5.2 (19Apr96)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ MPG: fixed a bug when allocating MPG buffers if the height 
	       was greater than the width.

	+ FLI: fixed a bug introduced in 27051 that affects some FLIs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.5.1 (12Apr96)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ AUD:  with the +f option, stopping moving restarting  or
	        playing backward then forwards could occasionally
		break audio. Now fixed. This bug was recently
	 	introduced, but not sure when.

	+ AVI:	added +F dithering support to CRAM16 Video Codec.

	+ BUG:  fixed bug in 2x2 dithering used by Cinepak. 
	        Was introduced in 2705 as I tried to improved the dithering.
                This caused potential core dumps.

	+ HPDEV:  setting sampling rate occasionally failed because 
	          /dev/audio reported it was busy. Now loop on that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.5 (04Apr96)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ AVI:     fixed Ultimotion bug with 16/24 depth displays.
		   I didn't correct generate the correct colors. 

	+ WIDGETS: I'm starting to do my own GUI. Eventually, I will
                   no longer support Athena, Athena3d or Motif.
                   Quite frankly, it's been a pain trying to support
                   them with all sorts of library, include, portability
		   and installation problems.  

		   Use XA_REMOTE_DEFS = -DXA_PETUNIA instead. Not saying
		   it's better, just more portable across the X11
                   platforms and less bothersome(to me). Also, it's the
		   only GUI I plan on support and improving on now.
		   Constructive feedback welcome.

	+ QT:   added YUV2 support for depth 16 and 24 Displays.
	+ MOVI: added display depth > 8 support to MVC1 video codec.
	+ MOVI: added +F dithering to MVC1 video codec.
		This slows it down considerably. So use -F to turn off
		or +CF4 as an alternative method. Will try to optimize
		later.
	+ AVI:  added support for RGB depth  4 Video Codec
	+ AVI:  added support for RGB depth 16 Video Codec
	+ IFF:  fixed compile error with fprintf statements.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.4.3
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ removed erroneous "static" from the xa_wav.c and xa_avi.c 
	  files. Caused compile errors with some compilers.
	+ Redid how audio-only files are merged with video files.
	  See the "+Am" and the "+AM" options in the xanim.read
	  or the xanim.man files.
	+ AUDIO: with audio only files, you know have 100ms resolution
	  for single stepping through that file. 
	+ AVI: Added support for audio only AVI files.
	+ QT:  Added support for audio only QT files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.4.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ Replaced bcopy with memcpy for those machines without bcopy.
	+ QT: Added dithering to RPZA Video Codec(makes it twice as slow).
	   use the +F or -F option to turn it on or off respectively.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.4.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
        + Bug fix for machines without audio.
          I tested it, I fixed something else and broke it. argh. :^)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.70.4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	+ video/audio sync fixed. Was broken in 2.70.3(actually it was
           only partially implemented after a change I did).
	+ QT: IMA4 audio codec, mono/stereo added.
	+ QT: fixed bug that caused lack of sync with some animations.
	  Had to do with incorrectly determining frame timing.
	+ QT: fixed RLE8 bug that caused trailers.
	+ QT: fixed YUV2 bug.
	+ JPEG: fixed bug in 21_11_11 JPEG files with depth 16 and 24 displays.
          Caused core dumps.
	+ JPEG: fixed bug that caused corruption with some images.
	+ JPEG: added support for 41_11_11 images/anims.
	+ MPEG: fixed bug that caused corruption with some newer
	  mpegs. NOTE: XAnim doesn't suport mpeg files with interleaved
          audio yet.
	+ AVI: XAnim now used AVI IDX1 chunk if present instead of scanning
          the entire AVI file. If AVI file is truncated or coming in
          from a serial stream, then it defaults back to scanning.
	  This greatly speeds up CDROM reading with +f option.
	+ AVI/WAV: added MSADPCM stereo audio support.
	+ AVI/WAV: added DVI/IMA mono/stereo audio support.
	  NOTE: both old and new DVI formats supported. User needs to
           use "+k2" option with old DVI format. Only way to tell is
           if it sounds "bad" and "+k2" fixes it. Whadda pain.
	+ SGI Movie format support added. Just JPEG and MVC1 Video codecs.
          MVC2 not yet supported.
	+ stdin input for the following formats *ONLY*: 
		AVI, FLI, FLC, DL, GIF, IFF, Movie_Setters and RLE
	+ ftp input for the following formats *ONLY*: 
		AVI, FLI, FLC, DL, GIF, IFF, Movie_Setters and RLE
          Still needs to load entire file.  User needs to define
          XANIM_USER and XANIM_PASSWD env variables. Typically
          anonymous and user's email address are used.
	+ Audio Conversion routines rewritten to improve freq conversion.
	+ -DXA_FORK define no longer needed.
	+ HP: HP Audio SUPPORT IS BROKEN IN 2.70.4. Use HPDEV instead.
	  will hopefully be fixed.
	+ -Ae option to turn off audio wasn't working. fixed.
	+ Probably a lot of other stuff I forgot about.
