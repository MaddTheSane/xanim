Since I don't have any type of access to VMS machines, I can't
provide much assistance in helping you compile XAnim on VMS machines.

I am grateful to the several individuals who provided and modified
the following files for use in compiling XAnim on VMS systems.

	make.com	make comand file for XAnim.
	descript.mms	MMS Description file for XAnim.
	xanim.hlp	VMS help file based on older rev 
			of unix xanim.readme.

If you are using the "descript.mms" file, then you want to edit
that file in the "Linker Options Sections", you will want
to uncomment just one of the OPT defines accordingly to which
version of DECWindows that you have.

If you are using "make.com" then you do not need to modify the
file. It should automatically detect which DECWindows you
are using.

With 2.70.4, neither of these files have been tested after I
modified them.
